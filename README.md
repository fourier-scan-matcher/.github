This organisation features resources around **FSM**, the Fourier Scan Matching method. FSM may match two range scans from a 2D LIDAR sensor whose field of view is 360 degrees in real time. FSM is robust to sensor noise, void correspondences, high-frequency components and distance between measurements. These are due to the dispensing with correspondences, which the use of the Discrete Fourier Transform affords FSM.
